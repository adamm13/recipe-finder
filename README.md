# Recipe Finder

This App was built to practice using TypeScript and React. It uses axios in a proxy server to call the [Recipe Puppy API](http://www.recipepuppy.com/about/api/). This tutorial explained how TypeScript can be used in react to write cleaner, less buggy code by using custom [TypeScript Interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html).
